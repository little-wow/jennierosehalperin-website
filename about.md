Let’s make things happen.

My passion is community facilitation, and my expertise and training are in public policy and librarianship.

Since 2020, I’ve been the Director of Library Futures, a project of the NYU Engelberg Center that addresses issues in digital libraries. Since receiving my MLS in 2013, I have worked in content, web development, and digital services. I can help you tell your story, brand your organization, manage your project or product, run research processes, or teach your organization how to work better together.

I am also a technology policy expert, building creative policy solutions and communications for big, sticky problems. I have a BA from Barnard College of Columbia University, an MLIS from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Humboldt Universität in Berlin, and an MPA from New York University.

Sometimes I publish academically, and my work appears regularly in the collective experiment *Flaming Hydra*. I am the co-chair of the Copyright Legislation Education and Advocacy Network for the American Library Association and a frequent keynote speaker on intellectual freedom, technology policy, open source, and technology systems.

In 2021, I was named a “Tech Policy Visionary” by Public Knowledge. I serve on the advisory board of the Flickr Foundation and previously served on the board of Invest in Open Infrastructure.

Building community—especially bringing people together around ideas—is my superpower.
